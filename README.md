# City Furniture Frontend Code Challenge

Welcome and thank you for taking the time to complete this code challenge

## Requirements

- Create a React Project ( typescript if you want ) that uses Server Side Rendering
- Pull from API `https://randomuser.me/api/?page=1&results=20&seed=abc` in pages with 20 results
  - Upon opening pull from server side and populate data
  - Imagine that you are out of users when you hit page 50
- Either use infinite scrolling to load the next page or a standard pagination model

- Create a nav bar at the top to search through current results by first name, last name and both
- Handle loading however you would like
